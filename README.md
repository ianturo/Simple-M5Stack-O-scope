# Simple-M5Stack-O-Scope

## This is a didactic project
To learn the basic operation of a DSO build with a electronic hobbyist common components.

## Note to consider
Whit this small code write in arduino you can run quickly a very simple oscilloscope, that can draw signal up to 50KHz, if you want a project with advanced features I recommend this project: [STM32-O-Scope](https://github.com/pingumacpenguin/STM32-O-Scope/), that even it using an STM32 board, it is very simple to build.

## Atencion: The ESP32 processor only support 3.3v maximum in the analog imputs, if you need measure signals with higher voltages please implement a voltage divisor before.

Examples

## ESP32 y ST7735
